	abstract = {Previous attempts at estimating the economic model of crime with aggregate data relied heavily on crosssection econometric techniques, and therefore do not control for unobserved heterogeneity. This is even true of studies which estimated simultaneous equations models. Using a new panel dataset of North Carolina counties, we exploit both single and simultaneous equations panel data estimators to address two sources of endogeneity: unobserved heterogeneity and conventional simultaneity. Our results suggest that both labor market and criminal justice strategies are important in deterring crime, but that the effectiveness of law enforcement incentives has been greatly overstated. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{Baltagi2006,
	abstract = {This paper replicates the Cornwell and Trumbull (1994) estimation of a crime model using panel data on 90 counties in North Carolina over the period 1981-1987. While the Between and Within estimates are replicated, the fixed effects 2SLS as well as the 2SLS estimates are not. In fact, the fixed effects 2SLS estimates turn out to be insignificant for all important deterrent variables as well as legal opportunity variables. We argue that the usual Hausman test, based on the difference between fixed effects and random effects, may lead to misleading inference when endogenous variables of the conventional simultaneous equation type are among the regressors. We estimate the model using random effects 2SLS and perform a Hausman test based on the difference between fixed effects 2SLS and random effects 2SLS. We cannot reject the consistency of the random effects 2SLS estimator and this estimator yields plausible and significant estimates of the crime model. This result should be tempered by the legitimacy of the chosen instruments. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},
